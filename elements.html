								 This mount was created for a client's software company in order to fulfill requirements
								 for government contracts with state and federal bodies. For this specific project the company uses proprietary 
								 facial recognition software in order to match crime scene footage with known criminal databases in order to create 
								 a list of potential suspects. My task on this project was to create a custom physical mount to hold the computer 
								 system, cameras, and other components. As the cameras and other components used varied in size and orientation, 
								 the mount had to be modeled as to be unique for that specific purpose. The prototype was eventually created using 
								 various 3D printing techniques and materials with the idea that large-scale production should be reserved for the 
								 specific contract as various applications would necessitate different manufacturing methods or materials depending 
								 on the size of order and requirements.

								</span> The average American spends 9.3 hours per day sitting, which can lead to a variety of health issues and pain.
								 This product was created for a variety of reasons, but with the main being to help users have a more comfortable and
								  healthy posture when using computer devices. Essentially it can be used as either a standing or sitting desk with complete 
								  customization to fit the specific user. This device was designed not only for applications in commercial offices, 
								  but also can be used by remote workers, medical rooms, or for outdoor applications where robust mounting is necessary, such 
								  as for a National Geographic photographer/editor. I was involved in all phases of the design process, including assisting with 
								  the initial design, sourcing materials, 
								  building computers models, and creating a variety of different versions of the product, going through the entire design process. 
								  <br>
								  <br>
								The creator had the opportunity to do a TEDx talk with the product in order to help bring awareness to it.

								</span> For this specific project, I was tasked with creating a product that could use a variety of standard-sized 
								airhorns with a trip wire in order to set them off as an alarm system. For commercial use, the system uses a standard
								 trip wire to trigger the alarm with the idea that it can be used to prevent home invasion or be used for camping
								  purposes. The original creator came up with the idea when, while out on a hike, his campsite was ransacked by a 
								  bear. The device could be used to prevent dangerous wildlife from encroaching on areas where they are not wanted,
								   or even used as a passive home defense solution. The product went through several iterations, with the final design
								    being created using sheet metal in order to provide a cheap to manufacture, robust, and scalable solution. 
								For more serious applications where range requirements are increased and human life are at stake, initial prototypes
								 were created using laser systems in order to trigger the alarms. The client's end goal was to sell this product as both 
								 a commercial camping/outdoor and defense device, but also as a tool to be sold to the military to use on special missions 
								 where soldiers might be in dangerous territory where they wouldn’t want to be taken by surprise.  For these projects I assisted 
								 throughout the entire engineering design process, creating models as well as final products for sale.

								</span> This product was created as per forestry service requirements in order to help get supplies/people 
								to harder-to-access areas in remote regions. It incorporates the option for various wheel sizes and types, 
								with the base model using standard recycled bike parts such as forks, wheels and tires. With diversity in 
								mind during the design process, the final product has several applications that can be used for a variety of 
								purposes. Some of these include getting supplies to hard-to-reach areas, using it as a gurney to carry injured 
								people out of the woods, or for firefighters to use in order to fight wildfires. Iterations of this design
								 were also made to use an electric motor to help the user move loads as an e-bike does with its rider. My 
								 tasks with this project were to assist throughout the design process, create computer models/simulations 
								 of the designs, and source materials for manufacturing with the client ultimately handling manufacture and assembly.

									</span>UV light has frequently been used as a cleaning agent for various 
									mediums such as the air, water and non-porus surfaces such as those used in the medical industry.
									This design is a water filtration product created using UV light in order to 
									clean water for drinking purposes. It includes a rechargable battery for repeated use. 
									Orginally, it was created for camping and traveling purposes, but it has alternative applications, and 
									the technology could be applied to other designs, or larger-scale filtration systems. </p>

									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/PF-ISO-SW.png" alt="iso"

									</span>The part was designed in Solidworks in order to fit into a standard camping water bottle and 
									is only 40mm wide. Part fittings were tested in Solidworks Assembly and then 3D printed in order to create a 
									prototype of the model. Several iterations of this design, as well as a variety of styles, were created. 
									The instrument operates by setting the amount of water to be filtered, then the device
									selects the appropriate amount of time to use the UV light to clean the water. Due to UV light filtration having so many 
								applications, it would be possible to make designs that could also be used in a similar fashion to Brita® Filters or even attachments 
							for a standard sink. With that being said, the design shown here would be used primarily for camping and other outdoor activities, where the 
						light-weight and mobile device would serve as a way to get clean drinking water without the need of a large and laborious filter system. </p>

									</span>UV water filtration is one of the most effective methods for creating clean drinking water as it is
									effective against all microorganisms (removes 99.99%). It also will not change the taste of the water, takes very little time 
								to clean the water when compared to other methods (30 minutes vs. 90 seconds), and is also smaller/lighter when 
								compared to other filters. The device is also designed to be left in the water bottle and will automatically clean the water periodically. 
								With little to no maintenance costs, it is an environmentally and budget freindly option that helps eliminate the need for buying 
							sealed plastic bottles of water.  </p>

								This specific device was created in order to fit onto standard sized water bottles that are

								for fitmit in order to create a prototype. This device functions by the power button on the center of the
								lid being used to activate the UV lights inside the device that will then filter the dangerous water to clean and safe drinking water 
								in a matter of seconds. It also features a water-proof rechargable port on the top of the bottle, with all

								that it will not change the taste of the water, takes very little time to clean the water when compared to other methods
								 (30 minutes vs. 90 seconds). This particular model is a part of your water storage, so it is not required to have any 
								 extra devices/weight while being easy to use. The design also requires little to no maintenance costs and is a one-time 
								environmentally freindly investment as it will also eliminate the need for single-use plastic bottles.  </p>

									</span>Machine learning and deep learning are forms of artificial intelligence (AI) that effectively automate 
									the process of analytical model building and allow machines to adapt to new scenarios independently.
									This is beneficial because it allows systems to take data sets, identify patterns, and make educated decisions with minimal 
									human intervention. However, for the average person with little to no coding knowledge or computer experience, this can 
									be a daunting task. The goal of this project was to create an easy-to-use tool capable of using multiple 
									comparison methods in order to analyze various data sets.  Effectively, this allowed the average person to become a data 
									scientist using free open-source software.

									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/3d print image.jpg" alt="iso" 
										
										style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px;"></img>
									</span>This goal was accomplished by using the open-source graph programming software KNIME in order to create the comparison 
									model. The tool took various large data sets and used several machine learning methods as well as various deep learning 
									methods in order to analyze the contents. Once the analysis was complete, the program then organized the outputs from the 
									models in order to compare and show which method was best for the given data set. Orginally, the project was created in order 
									to look at flexible electronic data from a 3D printer that would be used to cover airplane wings with malleable solar panels. JSON files from the 3D printers were analyzed 
									using the machine learning methods in order to determine what settings would be ideal for various printing configurations 
									based on velocity, gap length/height, distance, etc. Deep learning methods were also used in the same manner, but with 
									images from the printer instead of JSON files. Essentially, the model trained itself using AI to determine what print settings to use 
									for any print. </p>
									
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Knime comparison 2.png"

									</span>  The tool was then applied to other data sets such as carbon nanotube growth, metal additive thermal histories, as well
								as ACES corrosion test chamber data. The comparison methods were successful, ranging in accuracy from 78% to over 99%  
								(different data sets work better with different methods). Although this may seem like a large
								range, the power of the tool comes from its ability to show the user what method they should use for their specific data set and why. This 
								is useful as it allows the user to pick the most accurate method for each task, and not be reliant on one type of machine learning or deep 
								learning method. The tool proved successful for the various data sets and it also showed that it is possible for the average person to
								analyze and explore large data sets using graph programming.   </p>

									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/motorcycle iso.jpg" 
										 
										style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px;"></img>
									</span>In the summer of 2021 after completing my undergraduate degrees in aerospace engineering and mechanical engineering and during the pandemic,
									 I undertook a project that would spark an entirely new passion
										and hobby. Over roughly an 18-month period, I fully rebuilt and re-designed a 1978 Honda CX500. 
										As an engineer, the CX500 facinated and intrigued me as it was the first water-cooled V-Twin motorcycle engine ever produced. 
										The bike had not been operated in close to 40 years, and had been sitting to rust in my grandfather's garage. This project consisted 
										of learning many new skills, and it allowed me to apply my newly acquired engineering knowledge in order to take a historic piece of 
										Honda engineering and breathe life back into it. 

									 </p>
									
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/motorcycle-side.jpg" alt="iso" 
										
										style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;"></img>
									</span> The first step in the project was obviously to get the bike running. After installing a new battery, the next step was to 
									troubleshoot and check every component using a multimeter, starting from the battery and moving towards the starter. After replacing and
									soldering some wires, rebuilding a solenoid, checking all the resistances into the motorcycle CDI, and replacing some old fuses, power 
									finally flowed from the battery to the starter. I then had to open the engine and repair frozen piston rings in order to un-seize the engine, 
									but eventually the motorcycle started. I then took the curberators apart and cleaned multiple times, and then adjusted to get the optimal
									 air-to-fuel ratio for peak efficiency. Once complete, the rear-end of the bike was removed using an an angle grinder and replaced with a U-bar 
									 that was arc welded to the frame. The wiring harness was then removed from the bike in order to solder and connect the new wires for the various 
									 electronic components that were replaced. The remainder of the aesthetic work was then completed, including the stripping, filling, painting and 
									 clear-coating of mulitple parts, adding/machining new components, updating the system to handle LEDs and so forth. 
									
									  </p>
									
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/motorcycle-back.jpg" 
										
										style="width: 100%; max-width: 450px;"></img>
									</span>  Overall, the project was one of my favorite and most memorable endevours. It allowed me to apply the knowedge I had acquired through multiple 
									years of formal and informal settings and use it on a large, prolonged project. I gained experience with welding, soldering, using multimeters to troubleshoot,
									precision measurment devices, body work and it allowed me to use my hands-on knowedge in ways university had begun to help me to forget. Most importantly, it 
									allowed me to grow closer to my grandfather during the final years of his life and gave me a reason to spend multiple days a week at his shop for hours on end. 
									In total, the project required roughly 200 hours of work, with half of those coming from research alone. </p>

									<h2 id="CNC Drawing Machine">CNC Drawing Machine </h2>
									
									
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/cnc-whole.jpg" 
										style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;"></img>
									</span> This project was completed in order to gain experience with CNC machines and 
									improve my knowledge of G-Code and programming. It also gave me experience using various
									mechanical components that were assembled together using 3D printed housings/supports. As 
									practically all CNC machines function similarly with the primary difference being the bit-holder,
									the theory of this design would work as a laser cutter, rotating bit CNC, 3D printer, etc. 

									 </p>
									
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/cnc-close.jpg" alt="iso" 
										style="width: 100%; max-width: 375px;"></img>
									</span>  The device uses a standard 12V power supply and operates by using an arduino uno and CNC
									 shield to control the electronic components. A pen can be raised or lowered into position using a servo arm and cable.
									 Two stepper motors control the movement of the parts by
									 moving rubber belts that are connected to the various components. The design features two metal rods connected 
									 to linear ball bearings that allow the components to move on the y-axis, while a lineral rail controls movement 
									 on the x-axis. There are also two contact switches that tell the device when to stop its position. Mounting 
									 components were 3D printed and connected to a plywood base.
									
								</p>
									
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/drawing 1.jpg" 
										style="width: 100%; max-width: 350px;"></img>
										
									</span>  The CNC machine uses free open-source software GRBL and Inkscape in order to control the arduino. 
									The device proved to be successful and allowed for the creation of drawings using various mediums 
									as it can be used to draw on paper, clothing, edible food and more. 
									It allowed me to gain more experience using arduino and CNC devices, soldering and Dupont connections, and 
									practice with the wiring, setup, and control of other mechanical devices. Although the device was created to 
									use a standard-sized sheet of paper, it could easily be scaled using longer rails or even modified to use other mediums 
									such as a laser engraver/cutter, cutting bit, etc.

									</span> I have always had a passion for how design applies to art and the tools required to do so. 
									This started when I was young and has since forth culminated into a life-long interest in the arts. 
									Be it woodworking, sculpture, pottery, music, painting, drawing, photography, or designing things on the computer,
									 I have always had a passion for creating art. The most recent medium that has sparked my interest was the use of
									 various computer softwares to create art. The majority of the pieces shown below were created using the 
									 computer aided design (CAD) software Solidworks in order to create models of my various ideas and inspirations.
