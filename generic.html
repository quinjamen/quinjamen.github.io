									<h1>My name is <br />
									Quinn Minor</h1>
									<p>I am a college graduate with a degree in mechancial engineering as well as aerospace engineering. 
									Throughout my entire life I have had a passion and interest in how things operated. From creating any one thing I 
									could in my father's workshop as a child, to building my own motorcycles and creating designs of my 
									ideas in my freetime, I developed a strong interst in using my hands and my problem-solving skills. 
									Later in life, this evolved into an interest in engineering, which subsequently led to me getting two degrees. Throughout 
								 	my years of studying and working in industry, my interst in engineering only continuted to grow, culminating to where we are today.  </p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Lake Bled 2.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Orginally, I am from Morgantown, West Virginia. As I previously mentioned, I have always had a strong interest in
									 engineering as well as design. I enjoy the process of problem solving (as all engineers do), and love the satisfaction 
									 of creating a simple solution to a complex issue. I believe that solutions should be straightforward, beautiful, artistic as well as intuitive. 
									One day I hope to lead my own engineering team in order to design products to improve the world in whatever facet that may be.
									I understand that large goals such as these can not be achieved without hard work and dedication and I believe I have a firm grasp
									of what is required not only due to my professional achievement, but also my varied hobbies and interests.
										</p>

								<p>I also enjoy spending as much of my time traveling as possible. Throughout my travels,
									 I have been to almost 30 countries, from the volcanos of El Salvador in Central America, 
									 to the war-torn cities of Bosnia and Herzegovina. I have also worked on a farm in Switzerland, 
									 studied amazing artwork in Europe, eaten strange food on the Mediterranean, sunbathed on exotic 
									 beaches in The Balkans, viewed impressive architecture in Scandinavian countries, made friends with 
									 people from all over the world, and visited historical sites while absorbing these diverse cultures.
									I currently am located in Southern Arizona, where I am continuing to further my learning while avoiding 
								scorpions and other dangerous wildlife. </p>

									 <p>Outside of engineering and traveling, I also enjoy spending my time creating art through multiple medias, 
										 doing woodworking, playing multiple musical instruments, photography, and training and following combat sports 
										 such as MMA, boxing and kickboxing. As I love to answer questions, feel free to reach out if you have 
										 shared interests in anything mentioned!
